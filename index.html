    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>DJS Racing is proud to continue our successful partnership with JLCPCB, a cornerstone of our high-performance electric vehicle endeavors.</p>
    <p>Once again, JLCPCB has been instrumental in our progress, providing us with exceptional multi-layer PCBs that are the foundation of our high-voltage battery pack. Their reliable, long-lasting components have been essential for our intricate circuit designs.</p>
    <p>We've made significant strides this year, including the development of our in-house Battery Management System (BMS) PCBs, made possible through JLCPCB's continued support. Their cost-effective solutions have been invaluable in optimizing our budget and allowing us to invest in other critical project areas.</p>
    <p>JLCPCB's rapid turnaround times and dedicated support team remain essential to our efficiency. We're excited to expand our collaboration by integrating their PCBs into our new data acquisition system, a crucial step in refining our vehicle's performance.</p>
    <p>To further enhance our vehicle's capabilities, we're incorporating an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) using JLCPCB's trusted PCBs. This will provide invaluable data for optimizing our vehicle's design.</p>
    <p>We look forward to the continued growth of our partnership with JLCPCB as we push the boundaries of electric vehicle technology.</p>

        <h2>Supplies and Testing Steps</h2>
        <p><strong>Step 1: Continuity Test</strong> - A continuity test ensures proper connectivity of conductive traces on the PCB.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2: Power Up Unsoldered PCB</strong> - Check for short circuits or electrical faults before soldering.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3: Soldering and Testing</strong> - Gradually solder components and perform incremental testing.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4: Complete PCB Testing</strong> - Comprehensive testing under controlled lab conditions.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5: Real-World Testing</strong> - Test PCBs in the vehicle to ensure proper functionality under real conditions.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Our project has successfully completed one iteration of the first four steps, and we are excited to further test, validate, and recalibrate a fresh batch of high-quality PCBs by JLCPCB to lock in our design.</p>
